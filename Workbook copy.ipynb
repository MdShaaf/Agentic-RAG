Examples of this type are \\nexports measured monthly and rninfall measured daily. Finally, some time \\nseries are inherently discrete, an example being the dividend paid by a \\ncompany to shareholders in successive years. \\nMuch statistical theory 1s concerned with random samples of independent \\nobservations. The special feature of time-series analysis is the fact that \\nsuccessive observations are usually not independent and that the analysis must \\ntake into account the time order of the observations. When successive \\nobservations are dependent, future values may be predicted from past \\nobservations. If a time series can be predicted exactly, it is said to be \\ndeterministic. But most time series are stochastic in that the future is only \\npartly determined by past values, so that exact predictions are impossible and\\n\\n(Page 16) describes how the variation in a time series may be accounted for by cyclic \\ncomponents at different frequencies.
